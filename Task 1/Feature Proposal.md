# Proposal: Employee Management RESTful Web Service

1. **Introduction**
    
    This proposal outlines the design of a RESTful web service to manage employee data using **Java Spring Boot** and **HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform**. The service will provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records, stored securely on a private cloud server powered by HPE GreenLake.
    
2. **Tech Stack Overview**
    - **Java Spring Boot**: Java Spring Boot simplifies the development of RESTful APIs by providing a robust framework to handle routing, data access, and dependency injection. Its lightweight nature and modularity make it ideal for building microservices.
    - **HPE GreenLake**: A cloud platform offering scalable and secure cloud resources, HPE GreenLake will host the service, ensuring data security and scalability. The service will leverage GreenLake’s private cloud to manage employee data securely.

3. **API Design**
    
    The RESTful web service will offer the following endpoints:
    
    1. **GET /employees**: Fetches the complete list of employees.
        - **Response**: Returns a JSON array containing employee objects with fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `employee_id`, `email`, and `title`.
    
    2. **POST /employees**: Adds a new employee to the list.
        - **Request Body**: A JSON object with required fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `title`.
        - **Response**: Returns a confirmation with the generated `employee_id`.
    
    3. **PUT /employees/{id}**: Updates an existing employee’s information.
        - **Request Body**: A JSON object with any of the editable fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `title`).
        - **Response**: Returns a confirmation of the updated employee details.
    
    4. **DELETE /employees/{id}**: Deletes an employee from the list based on their `employee_id`.
        - **Response**: Returns a confirmation of the deletion.

4. **Data Structure**
    
    Each employee record will have the following fields:
    
    - `first_name`: Employee’s first name (String)
    - `last_name`: Employee’s last name (String)
    - `employee_id`: A unique identifier (Integer, auto-generated)
    - `email`: Employee’s email address (String)
    - `title`: Job title (String)

5. **Storage and Security**
    
    Employee data will be stored in a **relational database** hosted on the HPE GreenLake cloud. The private cloud configuration ensures that only authorized personnel have access, in compliance with data protection regulations. The service will also implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to restrict access to API endpoints.
    
6. **Conclusion**
    
    By combining Java Spring Boot for rapid API development with HPE GreenLake’s secure cloud infrastructure, this solution will provide a scalable, secure, and efficient employee management system that fulfills the requirements of the RESTful web service.
